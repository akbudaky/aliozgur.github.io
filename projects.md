Here you can find a short list of some projects developed by me or by the teams I've managed during my career. I'm proud that I was involved in these projects which I think helped me shape my software development career.

## PragmaSQL
PragmaSQL is a T-SQL editor which I've started developing during summer of 2005 (The name was actually InfoSQL). The initial version was developed with Delphi 6 and was used extensively by Bilgi University's Software Development team. The team provided lots of feedback and at some point, I guess that was in 2007, I decided to port PragmaSQL to .NET with C#. I love Delphi very much and I still have some apps used in production (yes I know we are in 2015) and from time to time I still provide support to those apps. But in 2007 or some time around these years Borland was losing developer attraction which made .NET and C# a good alternative.

During 2007 I've completed porting Delphi 6 code to  C#. Then I published PragmaSQL as a commercial product. And that was an important point in my career, because I started to run my own small business. During this period I had the chance to practice running a commercial product. Some notable things of that period are

* I've created a web site dedicated to PragmaSQL
* I've used Cuyahoga CMS, one of the first .NET based open source CMS implementations, to host the PragmaSQL site
* I've developed some plugins for Cuyahoga, which introduced me to the open source .NET community
* I've published couple of articles on CodeProject related to Cuyahoga plugins I've developed
* I've created my own license validation component which was talking to PragmaSQL web site over web services 
* PragmaSQL got The Code Project's Members Choice Award in General Database Tools category in 2009 and 2010

After maintaining PragmaSQL as a commercial product for two years I open sourced the code at the beginning of 2011 on Codeplex. PragmaSQL is now at version 3 and is still [open source](https://github.com/aliozgur/pragmasql). Among many users Bilgi University's Software Development team continues to use PragmaSQL as their main T-SQL editor.

### Some More Delphi Love

* Torry's Delphi Pages : Components, forums and lot's of fun Delphi stuff.
* ProjectXPlorer : Delphi addin I've developed. Inspired by Visual Studio Solution Explorer. Still in use.
* Developer Express Suite 
* DPack for Delphi

## SUGES
SUGES is a DCU and RTU data collection and control system. Me and my team at PragmaTouch  developed SUGES for a local natural gas and electricity distribution company. The main purpose of the system is to collect data from DCU and RTU devices and manage the devices installed on the field. 

The technologies used are C#, ASP.NET MVC, ServiceStack, Quartz.NET and Redis.

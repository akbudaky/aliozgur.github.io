This page is intended to provide some background and details for couple of projects I was involved with during my professional career. 
I think these projects, among many others, helped me shape my software development skills. 

If you want to see all the projects I was involved with [please visit my LinkedIn profile](http://linkedin.com/in/aliozgur)

## PragmaSQL
PragmaSQL is a T-SQL editor which I've started developing during summer of 2005. 
The initial name was InfoSQL which was developed with Delphi 6.
In 2007 I've ported InfoSQL to .NET and renamed the project as PragmaSQL.
By the end of 2007 I've implemented tons of features and I published PragmaSQL as a commercial product.

After maintaining PragmaSQL as a commercial product more than for two years I've decided to open source the code.
PragmaSQL is now at version 3 and is still [open source](https://github.com/aliozgur/pragmasql) and maintained.
PragmaSQL got The Code Project's Members Choice Award in General Database Tools category in 2009 and 2010

>Bilgi University Software Development Team still uses PragmaSQL as the main T-SQL editor which provides 
object history tracking and other great features.

* .NET, C#, WinForms and Reflection
* SharepDevelop AddIn support

## TaksiTV
TaksiTV started around 2009 and it was one of the greates projects I was involved with. The project started with the vision to bring 
credit card payment, advertisements and route display to all cabs in İstanbul/Turkey. The device used on cabs was a 
[series 9000 MDT](http://www.mobile-knowledge.com/products/driver-solutions/series-9008-mdt/) which was running WindowsCE 
and had GPS and 3G capabilities. Communication to the device was possible over a custom TCP protocol which was handled 
by a pre installed C++ application by MobileKnowledge.

I've developed a web content management and distribution system, couple of intelligent map extraction tools for this project.

>TaksiTV was deployed to couple of cabs for testing. Test setup was successfull and the company
was hunting for investors to organize the operations and other business stuff. However, due to some 
financial issues the project was cancelled after 1 year of development and testing by the company. 

**Tools and Technologies**

* Microsoft SQL Server
* ASP.NET
* C++
* Client/Server communication over TCP

## eXpressOto 
eXpressOto is a vehicle repair services and management application developed for 
[İSBAK](http://www.isbak.com.tr/en) which is a public company partially owned by İstanbul Municipality. 

eXpressOto was the first application I've developed with Microsoft Entity Framework as Object Relational Mapper. 
The ORM things was not new to me because I've developed number web applications with NHibernate 
(starting from version 0.5 as far as I can remember), LLBLGen Pro and SubSonic. 
But with eXpressOto I had the chance to explore all those great things offered by EF 
(I admit EF was hard than enough to work with at that time).

>eXpressOto is still in active use and runs the whole repair services process that result in multi million dollar transactions annually.

**Tools and Technologies**

* Microsoft SQL Server
* .NET, C#, WinForms and reflections
* Entity Framework 4
* Developer Express components and reporting tools

## JiraTouch

When I got my first iPod in 2009 I was enlightened with the fact that I could develop apps for this magical device and as a bonus
the app would work on the relatively new but yet very popular smart phone called iPhone. I discussed the idea with couple 
of fellow developers and we decided to create a mobile app for Jira. 

I've been a Jira user for more than 10 years and I've already developed a PragmaSQL addin for Jira. 
I was familiar with SOAP Api so that would be a piece of cake for me and the team to create a mobile app.
We purchased a used MacBook and started developing the app with the first version of MonoTouch. 
It has been a tough journey with lots of unknowns and new things. Platform was new, development tools were new 
and the team was new. The only knowns were Jira and the C# language. By the end of February in 2010 we published
the first version of JiraTouch on Apple AppStore with 9.90$ price tag. JiraTouch was the first mobile app for Jira
with extensive support for workflows, custom fields, file uploads, comments and bunch of other features.

> JiraTouch got thousands of downloads and was mintained by PragmaTouch team until 2013.

**Tools and Technologies**

* MonoTouch and C#
* Jira SOAP API
* iPhone (iOS) SDK

## SUGES
SUGES is a DCU and RTU data collection and control system. Me and my team at PragmaTouch developed SUGES for a natural 
gas and electricity distribution company located in Turkey. The main purpose of the system is to collect and display sensor data from DCU and RTU devices 
and manage the devices installed on the field. SUGES was designed and implemented with horizontal scalability in mind.

> SUGES is still in production and is used by the company to monitor and manage the natural gas collectors. 

**Tools and Technologies**

* .NET and C#
* ASP.NET MVC
* ServiceStack
* Quartz.NET
* Redis
* Microsoft SQL Server
* SuperSockets TCP/IP server
